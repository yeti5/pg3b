The Pan-Galactic Gargantuan Gargle Brain (PG3B) is an open source hardware and software platform to control and interact with an XBox 360 from a home computer, adapt your favorite input device, and develop exciting new input devices.

The PG3B hardware allows full control of the XBox 360 buttons, thumbsticks, and triggers as a virtual serial port using USB communications device class (USB CDC). Popular operating systems, such as Windows, MAC OS, and Linux support this interface with minimum driver requirements.

Java and C# .NET software libraries provide easy access to all of the XBox 360 controller features. Sophisticated applications using the core platform include Arcade, Keyboard, Mouse, and Joystick adapters.
